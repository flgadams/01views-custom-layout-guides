 Iâ€™ll demonstrate. We have four views that are to remain equally distributed vertically. I constrain the left and right edges of the four views, their heights, and the top of the first view and the bottom of the last view. Now we want to set the vertical position of the two middle views such that they are always equidistant from their vertical neighbors
